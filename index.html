    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a self taught coder that has worked my whole life. I've built houses, worked in a pizza place, bank and a window manufacturing
        facility. Along side everything that I have done, I have studied coding languages and new technologies. I have worked in linux,
        created and maintained virtual machines in both type 1 & 2 hypervisors. I love learing new things, and enjoy using that knowledge even more.
